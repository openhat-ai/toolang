## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.5] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Flow `exec` statements replace the current runnable within the same Run and
  never return on success. Named and inline targets use the same forms and input
  binding as `run`, and named targets resolve from the latest published State. (#675)

### Changed

- Resource selectors (`models`, `tools`, `psyches`, `skills`, `services`,
  `prompts`) now filter the latest State within their declaring modules. Children
  inherit restrictions rather than an earlier selected list, and `+=` restores
  only items still allowed by ancestors and authority ceilings. (#675)
- Hands/handoffs snapshots now omit only the current runnable and its ancestors
  on the calling branch, so earlier handoffs, completed children, and siblings are
  callable again. (#675)
- **Breaking:** the runtime call tool `_toolang/execute` (exposed as
  `_toolang__execute`) is renamed to `_toolang/exec` (`_toolang__exec`), and the
  public `ToolRuntime.execute()` method to `ToolRuntime.exec()`. Integrations that
  invoke the tool or implement the method must switch to `exec`. (#675)
- Execution progress dividers are unified: Run boundaries use `┌`/`└`, `Run` and
  `Execute` captions use sentence case, and loop iterations show centered counters
  such as `1/3`. (#672)

### Fixed

- The formatter normalizes `exec` statements consistently with other flow
  statements. (#676)
