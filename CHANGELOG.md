## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.6] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- `me` adds `me__loaded(receipts)`, which compares home-file `{key, digest}`
  receipts with the State bound to the calling Run and returns `loaded`, the
  loaded `revision`, and only mismatching keys. (#679)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** the `me` tools now address the current agent's home files by
  home-relative path instead of resource kind and name. `me__list()` takes no
  arguments; `me__get(key)` reads whole files; `me__create(key, content)` fails
  if the file exists; `me__update(key, content, if_digest)` replaces whole
  content; and `me__delete(key, if_digest)` deletes one file and no longer
  manages task/chore lifecycle. Integrations using the old `kind`/`key`
  arguments or field-level updates must migrate; restart older writers to
  release the retired `.authored-flows.lock` and `.project.lock`. (#679)

### Fixed

- Flow and prompt templates retain typed values (Boolean, struct, array, and
  `Part`) instead of coercing them to text, and native strings such as `"false"`
  are not re-parsed into other types. (#680)

## [0.3.5] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Flow `exec` statements replace the current runnable within the same Run and
  never return on success. Named and inline targets use the same forms and input
  binding as `run`, and named targets resolve from the latest published State. (#675)

### Changed

- Resource selectors (`models`, `tools`, `psyches`, `skills`, `services`,
  `prompts`) now filter the latest State within their declaring modules. Children
  inherit restrictions rather than an earlier selected list, and `+=` restores
  only items still allowed by ancestors and authority ceilings. (#675)
- Hands/handoffs snapshots now omit only the current runnable and its ancestors
  on the calling branch, so earlier handoffs, completed children, and siblings are
  callable again. (#675)
- **Breaking:** the runtime call tool `_toolang/execute` (exposed as
  `_toolang__execute`) is renamed to `_toolang/exec` (`_toolang__exec`), and the
  public `ToolRuntime.execute()` method to `ToolRuntime.exec()`. Integrations that
  invoke the tool or implement the method must switch to `exec`. (#675)
- Execution progress dividers are unified: Run boundaries use `┌`/`└`, `Run` and
  `Execute` captions use sentence case, and loop iterations show centered counters
  such as `1/3`. (#672)

### Fixed

- The formatter normalizes `exec` statements consistently with other flow
  statements. (#676)
